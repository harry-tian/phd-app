\section{Summary}




My research interest lies in in Human-AI interaction (HAI). I aim to building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration by leveraging AI that model humans. Currently, I am interested in (i) designing human-compatible decision support systems and AI teaching frameworks and (ii) the gap between HAI experiments on laypeople and practitioners.
