\subsect{brief overview of research interest}
Building effective human-AI collaboration requires more than mere well-performing models and high accuracy. For instance, how can we achieve strong human-AI team performance while retaining human agency? What are the mismatches between human-AI systems in lab settings and real-world practice and how can we bridge the gap?
Intrigued by these questions, I started to develop a human-centered perspective and formed my research interest in \textbf{Human-AI interaction (HAI)}. 
\subsect{current research}
As a predoctoral researcher at the Universtiy of Chicago, my research focuses on designing human-compatible AI frameworks for decision support and machine teaching. 
\subsect{future direction}
Ultimately, my goal is to help humans and society use AI systems more effectively and responsibly. 





% My research and experience had inspired my interests in the following problems:
%%%%%%% specific interest %%%%%%%
% I am esepcially interested in
% (1) designing AI assistance that inspires humans' appropriate reliance instead of blind trust 
% (2) AI learning human perception to provide better AI assistance
% .
% %%%%%% future direction %%%%%%%
% I intend to continue working on these problems with the larger goal of building AI asisstance that benefit humans while retaining human agency.
%%%%%%% motivation %%%%%%%
% I am motivated in this research direction because I am intrigued by the interactions between human and AI as two different decision-making entities and the complexities that arise.
