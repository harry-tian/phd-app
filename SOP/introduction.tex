%%%%%%% general interest %%%%%%%
Despite the impressive capabilties of current AI models, leveraging AI in human-AI teams and human-centered task is yet an open problem, one I am deely interested in.
%%%%%%% research experience %%%%%%%
As a predoctoral researcher at University of Chicago, my research focuses on \textbf{human-centered machine learning (HCML)}; 
in particular, we are designing AI-assistance frameworks for medical training. 
My research and experience had inspired my interests in the following problems:
%%%%%%% specific interest %%%%%%%
(1) designing AI assistance that inspires humans' appropriate reliance instead of blind trust 
(2) AI learning human perception to provide better AI assistance
.
%%%%%%% future direction %%%%%%%
% I intend to continue working on these problems with the larger goal of building AI asisstance that benefit humans while retaining human agency.

% For instance, I am working with Professor Chenhao Tan at UChicago to develop an AI-driven tutorial for medical training; we have shown our case-based decision support framework improves pneumonia diagnosis performance.

%%%%%%% motivation %%%%%%%
% I am motivated in this research direction because I am intrigued by the interactions between human and AI as two different decision-making entities and the complexities that arise.
