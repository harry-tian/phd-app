%%%%%%% general interest %%%%%%%
My research is in \textbf{human-centered machine learning (HCML)} and I am interested in tasks where human can benefit from AI assistance while retaining human agency. 
%%%%%%% motivation %%%%%%%
I am motivated in this research direction because I am intrigued by the interactions between human and AI as two different decision-making entities and the complexities that arise. 
%%%%%%% specific interest %%%%%%%
% My experience and research has inspired my interest in the following problems: 
specifically, I am interested in the following problems: 
(i) in human-AI teams, AI assistance often improves humans performance at the expense of humans' overreliance and blind trust towards AI [\citenum{bansal2021}], so how can we achieve
\textbf{humans' appropriate reliance towards AI?}
(ii) my work [\citenum{human-compat}] has shown AI learning human knowledge can provide better assistance for decision support ; 
\textbf{how can we better use AI to model human perception and intuition and leverage it for AI assistance?}
% (iii) how and when we can achieve human-AI complementary performance 
\\
%%%%%%% research experience %%%%%%%
% For instance, I am working with Professor Chenhao Tan at UChicago to develop an AI-driven tutorial for medical training; we have shown our case-based decision support framework improves pneumonia diagnosis performance.
