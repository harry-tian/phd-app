%%%%%%% general interest %%%%%%%
My research is in \textbf{human-centered machine learning (HCML)} and I am interested in machine-in-the-loop tasks where human can benefit from AI assistance while retaining human agency. 
%%%%%%% motivation %%%%%%%
I am motivated in this research direction because I am intrigued by the interactions between human and AI as two different decision-making entities and also because such research has more direct, visible impact. 
%%%%%%% research experience %%%%%%%
For instance, I am working with Professor Chenhao Tan at UChicago to develop an AI-driven tutorial for medical training; we have shown our case-based decision support framework improves pneumonia diagnosis performance.
%%%%%%% specific interest %%%%%%%
My experience and research has inspired my interest in the following problems: 
(i) generating AI assistance that inspires appropriate trust and reliance on the AI
and
(ii) using AI to model human perception and intuition.
% (iii) how and when we can achieve human-AI complementary performance
