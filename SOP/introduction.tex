\subsect{brief overview of research interest}
Building effective human-AI collaboration requires not only high-performing ML models and explanations but also an understanding of how humans and society use AI, such as retaining human agency and appropriate reliance on AI. Intrigued by this interdisciplinary direction, I started to develop a human-centered perspective and formed my research interest in \textbf{Human-AI interaction (HAI)}.
\subsect{current research}
My recent research focuses on designing human-compatible frameworks for AI-decision-support and machine teaching.
\subsect{future direction}
In general, I am interested in building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration by leveraging AI that model humans.





% My research and experience had inspired my interests in the following problems:
%%%%%%% specific interest %%%%%%%
% I am esepcially interested in
% (1) designing AI assistance that inspires humans' appropriate reliance instead of blind trust 
% (2) AI learning human perception to provide better AI assistance
% .
% %%%%%% future direction %%%%%%%
% I intend to continue working on these problems with the larger goal of building AI asisstance that benefit humans while retaining human agency.
%%%%%%% motivation %%%%%%%
% I am motivated in this research direction because I am intrigued by the interactions between human and AI as two different decision-making entities and the complexities that arise.
