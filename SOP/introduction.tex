\section{introduction}




My research interest is \textbf{human-centered artificial intelligence}, lying in the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI). 
% Specifically, I am interested in machine-in-the-loop tasks where human decision-making can benefit from AI assistance while retaining human agency. 
My experience and research at University of Chicago has inspired my interest in the following problems: 
(i) generating AI assistance that inspires appropriate trust and reliance on the AI
and
% (ii) how and when we can achieve human-AI complementary performance, and 
(ii) using AI to learn and model human perception and intuition.
