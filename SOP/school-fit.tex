% \noindent \textbf{Why UM-SI. }
All my experiences collectively shaped my research interests and motivated
me to pursue graduate studies. 
I believe HCI research at the School of Information at University of Michigan aligns with my goal of designing HAI systems that help humans in high-stake domains.
Specifically, I would be excited to work with Professor Ben Green. 
From his works I learned of the many issues in human-AI decision making, such as explanations not aligning with human decision-making process [\citenum{yacoby2022}] and the flaws of human overseeing algorithms [\citenum{green2022}]. 
I was particularly enlightened by the discussion in [\citenum{green2022}] about the upper bound of human oversight and the need for broader frameworks that do not soley depend on human individuals. I would be exicted to work with Professor Green by combining our interests in new frameworks for.
My research interests also overlap with Professor Etyan Adar's recent work on viewing explainable AI through Sensemaking Theory. 
I believe the strong HCI research at UM-SI will foster my research development in human-AI interaction.
