\section{general interest }






\subsection{interest}
%---------------------------------------------------------------
%	interest in HAI
%---------------------------------------------------------------
My interest in HAI is largely inspired by my research with Dr. Chenhao Tan at the University of Chicago as well as his course in Human-Center Machine Learning. 
Through course I learned of the human-related side of AI and the numerous complexities in human-AI interaction. When should fully delegate a task to AI who is responsible for the decisions? When AI is used as assistance to humans, how do we design fair and objective assistance instead of merely persuading humans to follow the AI? 
I am deeply intrigued by the interactions between human and AIs as black-box decision-making entities and I am deeply interested in solving the problems that arise.

\subsection{direct social impact}
%---------------------------------------------------------------
%	high impact
%---------------------------------------------------------------
But besides my interest, human-AI interaction and human-centered AI is an important direction of research as AI has increasingly significant influence in humans' decision-making. A core field of human-centered AI lies in high-stake domains like medical or juridical fields. Through my research in this direction, I have potential to produce direct and visible social impact.


\subsection{interdisciplinary}
%---------------------------------------------------------------
%	high impact
%---------------------------------------------------------------
Finally I enjoy the interdisciplinary aspects of human-centered AI research. My past research in human-compatible AI decision-support involved modeling human perception, an issue explored by experimental and cognitive psychologists. My current research aims to leverage our human-compatible AI to provide more effective teaching frameworks for radiology residents and we are exploring psychology literature in learning and categorization. More generally, human-centered AI revolves around how humans interact with a decision-making entity and thus involves many many different fields like economics, sociology, ethics, legal, etc. I greatly enjoy learning and combining knowledge from multiple fields. 




% Different from conventional technology that are mostly transparent and in full human control, current AI models are black-box decision-making entities that have may significant influences in humans' decision making, but the influences may not always be positive. In high-stake domains like medical diagnosis, complete reliance on AI decisions may not be desirable. Thus numerous issues arise, like generating AI assistance to inspire appropriate humans trust and reliance on AI, retaining human agency, how to properly explain model decisions, etc. I was intrigued by the plethora of complexities raised by the differences and incompatibilities between humans and AI. 

% My research in particular sparked my interest in how to design AI assistance to inspire appropriate human trust and reliance on the AI while simultaneously improving human performance.

% \subsection{interest in AI}
% My interest in the AI traces to my interest in computer science. I was amazed by what programming and algorithms can achieve and how they shape literally everything in the modern world. I was even more baffled when I learned of machine learning models; I am still fascinated by neutral networks' learning ability that arises from simple matrix transformations and gradient updates. 

% \subsection{interest in research}
% My interest in human-centered research can be attributed to the many social science and history courses I took as well as a childhood dream of doing good for mankind. I was never satisfied working solely on the technical, mathematical details of CS; I always aspired tackling issues that were more human-related have more direct and immediate social, "visible" impact. I still remember getting excited when attending a researcher talked about her projects that helped blind children learn in non-blind schools and an interactive projector that helped separated families play games on a table.

% \subsection{interest in interdisciplinary research}
% I also greatly enjoy the interdisciplinary aspects of human-centered AI research. As a Computer Science and Linguistics double major, my initial interest in ML was in NLP as I was excited to connect knowledge from both fields. I fulfilled my interdisciplinary passion as my past research in human-compatible AI decision-support involved modeling human perception, an issue explored by experimental and cognitive psychologists. My current research aims to leverage our human-compatible AI to provide more effective teaching frameworks for radiology residents and we are exploring psychology literature in teaching and learning. On a broader scale, human-centered AI revolves around how humans interact with a decision-making entity and thus involves many many different fields like economics, sociology, ethics, legal, etc.
