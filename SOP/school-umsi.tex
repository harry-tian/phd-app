\subsection*{Why I chose the University of Michigan}

\sect{my fit with the school/program}

All my experiences collectively shaped my research interests and motivated
me to pursue graduate studies. 
I believe the School of Information at University of Michigan aligns with my interest in HAI due to its focus on human-computer interaction (HCI) and connecting people and technology.
Specifically, I would be excited to work with Professor Ben Green. 
From his works I learned of the many issues in human-AI decision making, such as explanations not aligning with human decision-making process [\citenum{yacoby2022}] and the flaws of human overseeing algorithms [\citenum{green2022}]. 
I was particularly enlightened by the discussion in [\citenum{green2022}] about the upper bound of human oversight, making me realize that the human in HAI is not limited to human individuals. 
I would be excited to work with Professor Green on institutional oversight policies, which I think has potential beyond the government and public policy field. 
My research interests also overlap with Professor Etyan Adar's recent work on viewing explainable AI through Sensemaking Theory and Professor Anhong Guo's focus on hybrid human-AI intelligent interactive systems. 
% I am also in UM-SI's strong focus in computational social science (CSS). 
I believe the strong HCI and computational social science research at UM-SI will foster my research development in HAI.
