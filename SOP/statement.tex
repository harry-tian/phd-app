\section{short statement}




My objective is to pursue a Ph.D. with a focus on \textbf{human-centered artificial intelligence}, in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI). Specifically, I am interested in machine-in-the-loop tasks where human decision-making can benefit from AI assistance while retaining human agency. 
My past research has been focused on the following problems: (i) generating AI assistance that inspires appropriate trust and reliance on the AI, (ii) how and when we can achieve human-AI complementary performance, and (iii) using AI to learn and model human perception and intuition.
