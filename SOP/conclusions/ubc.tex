All my experiences collectively shaped my research interests and motivated me to enroll in a PhD program, where I can further develop my research career and pursue my goal of building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration. I believe the strong AI and HCI research at UBC's CS department aligns with my goal of designing effective and responsible HAI systems. Specifically, I would be excited to work with Professor Cristina Conati and Professor Giuseppe Carenini.
