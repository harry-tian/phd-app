All my experiences collectively shaped my research interests and motivated me to enroll in a PhD program, where I can further develop my research career and pursue my goal of building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration. I am drawn towards Northeastern's PhD in Computer Science program because of the department's strong ML and HCI research and human-centered focus.
There are quite a few faculty members whose research interests align well with mine. 
I am interested in Professor Dakuo wang's work on human-AI collaborative storytelling and QA generation [\citenum{yao-etal-2022-ais}, \citenum{xu-etal-2022-fantastic}, \citenum{Zhang2022-storybuddy}]. Specifically, I like the human-centered approach in \textit{StoryBuddy: A Human-AI Collaborative Agent for Parent-Child Interactive Storytelling with Flexible Parent Involvement} that directly involve parents, the users and stakeholders, in the human-AI framework design; one direction I am interested in is modifying the QAG model to learn human input or preferences in order to generate more personalized QA pairs.
I am also interested in Professor Byron Wallace's work on AI assistance in healthcare on end-user intelligent assistant, Professor Chenyan Jia's work on using AI to reduce political bias, and Professor Saiph Savage's work on using AI for government procedures and public policies.
