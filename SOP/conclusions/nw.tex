All my experiences collectively shaped my research interests and motivated me to enroll in a PhD program, where I can further develop my research career and pursue my goal of building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration. I am drawn towards Northwestern University's PhD in Computer Science program because of the department's strong AI and HCI research and human-centered focus.
There are quite a few faculty members whose research interests align well with mine. 
I am interested in Professor Jessica Hullman's direction in uncertainty representation, as I believe uncertainty to be important in humans' calibration of AI performance. I also found her work in the ethics and consequences of ML research to be inspiring as they reveal meta problems in the ML field[\citenum{Hullman_2022}, \citenum{Nanayakkara2021}].
I am also interested in Professor Brent Hecht's direction in mitigating biases from AI.
Overall, I find Northwestern to be a great match for my interests in HAI and I believe a PhD in Computer Science will allow me to further pursue my goal of building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration.
