% faculty 1
I am interested in Professor Jessica Hullman's direction in uncertainty representation, as I believe uncertainty to be important in humans' calibration of AI performance. I also found her work in the ethics and consequences of ML research to be inspiring as they reveal meta problems in the ML field[\citenum{Hullman_2022}, \citenum{Nanayakkara2021}].
% faculty 2-4
I am also interested in Professor Brent Hecht's direction in mitigating biases from AI.
% conclusion
My interests in HAI are well represented at Northwestern University, and I believe a PhD in Computer Science will foster my research skills and advance my goal of building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration.
