All my experiences collectively shaped my research interests and motivated me to enroll in a PhD program, where I can further develop my research career and pursue my goal of building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration. I believe the strong ML and HCI research at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame aligns with my goal of designing effective and responsible HAI systems. 
Specifically, I am interested in Professor Toby Jia-Jun Li's work on human-AI collaborative storytelling and QA generation [\citenum{yao-etal-2022-ais}, \citenum{xu-etal-2022-fantastic}, \citenum{Zhang2022-storybuddy}]. Specifically, I like the human-centered approach in \textit{StoryBuddy: A Human-AI Collaborative Agent for Parent-Child Interactive Storytelling with Flexible Parent Involvement} that directly involve parents, the users and stakeholders, in the human-AI framework design; one direction I am interested in is modifying the QAG model to learn human input or preferences in order to generate more personalized QA pairs.
I am also interested in Professor Meng Jiang's research on end-user intelligent assistant.
