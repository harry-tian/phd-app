Specifically, I am interested in Professor Toby Jia-Jun Li's work on human-AI collaborative storytelling and QA generation [\citenum{yao-etal-2022-ais}, \citenum{xu-etal-2022-fantastic}, \citenum{Zhang2022-storybuddy}]. Specifically, I like the human-centered approach in \textit{StoryBuddy: A Human-AI Collaborative Agent for Parent-Child Interactive Storytelling with Flexible Parent Involvement} that directly involve parents, the users and stakeholders, in the human-AI framework design; one direction I am interested in is modifying the QAG model to learn human input or preferences in order to generate more personalized QA pairs.

I am also interested in Professor Meng Jiang's research on end-user intelligent assistant.
% conclusion
My interests in HAI are well represented at University of Notre Dame, and I believe a PhD in Computer Science will foster my research skills and advance my goal of building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration.
