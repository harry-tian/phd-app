All my experiences collectively shaped my research interests and motivated me to enroll in a PhD program, where I can further develop my research career and pursue my goal of building more effective and responsible human-AI collaboration. I believe the strong ML and HCI research at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame aligns with my goal of designing effective and responsible HAI systems. 
Specifically, I am interested in Professor Toby Jia-Jun Li's work on human-AI collabrative storytelling and QA generation.


I am also interested in Professor Meng Jiang's research on.
